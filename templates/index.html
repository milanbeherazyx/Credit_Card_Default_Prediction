    <h1>Welcome to the Credit Card Default Prediction Machine Learning Project</h1>
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Credit Card Default Prediction</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Financial institutions face the challenge of predicting credit risk to assess the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their credit card payments. Accurate prediction of credit default is crucial for managing risk and making informed lending decisions. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.</p>
    
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>The primary objective of this project is to predict the probability of credit card default based on the credit card owner's characteristics and payment history. By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, the model will learn patterns and relationships between various features and the likelihood of default. This predictive model will assist financial institutions in assessing credit risk and taking appropriate measures to minimize potential losses.</p>
    
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The project will follow a typical machine learning workflow, including data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and model testing. Various machine learning algorithms will be experimented with to determine the most suitable approach for the credit card default prediction task. The cuDF library will be used for efficient data manipulation and analysis, taking advantage of GPU acceleration for faster computations.</p>
    
    <h3>Expected Results</h3>
    <p>The project aims to develop a robust machine learning solution that can accurately predict the probability of credit card default. The trained model will be capable of taking in credit card owner's characteristics and payment history as input and output the probability of default. This prediction capability will help financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding credit risk assessment and mitigating potential losses.</p>
